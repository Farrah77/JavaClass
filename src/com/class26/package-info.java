/* 
This Super keywords 

Using THis we can access current class instance variables.
To differentiate local and instance variables we use this keyword

Super is always referred to super class Constructor 


Super keyword:
super refers variable, constructor and method of a parent class
We use super when we access only constructor, to invoke constructor

This() and Super() can be used with Constructor to call current/parent class
constructor

Difference between this (for variables and methods) and this() (for constructors)

Constructor chaining -calling one constructor with another constructor within the same class 
Super is used to create parent class constructor

We can't use super with static, because static refers to class.
