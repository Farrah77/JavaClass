/* 
 * Inheritance:
 * child/derived/subclass class inherits properties and behaviors of the parent class
 * There 3 types of inheritance supported by Java classes
 *  - single
 *  - multilevel
 *  - hierarchy
 * 
 *  Plus 2 more types of inheritance, supported by Java Interfaces:
 *   - multiple
 *   - hybrid
 *   
 *  Polymorphism - 
 *  
 * 1. compile time/static/early binding - achieved through method
 *  overloading (same method name and different parameters within same class)
 * 
 * 2. runtime/dynamic/late binding - achieved through method overriding (same method name 
 * and same parameters within Parent-Child classes)
 * 
 * ABSTRACTION.
 * It is a process of hiding implementation details from the user and showing only 
 * important information (FUNCTIONALITY) to the user. 
 * 
 *  There are 2 ways TO ACHIEVE ABSTRACTION:
 *  - we can use abstract class -  
 *  - we can use interface
 * 
 * Abstract class can HAVE:
 * 1. static variables;
 * 2. instance variables
 * 3. Constructor
 * 
 *  Abstract class is a class having undefined (abstract - no body) methods. The purpose 
 *  of AC when we are not sure about the behavior we use abstract 
 *  
 *  Using AClass we can:
 *  - partial
 *  - no abstract
 *  - full abstract 
 *  
 *  IN ABSTRACT WE can;t have methods:
 *  - static
 *  - private
 *  - final 
 *  
 *  Interface - collection of the rules. These rules need to be implemented 
 *  in every child of that interface. 
 *  Interface can have only undefined methods
 *  
 *  1. By default all methods in IF are public and abstract
 *  2. We can't have STATIC methods in IF
 *  3. By default all variables are PUBLIC STATIC & FINAL
 *  4. We CAN NOT have instance variables -> by default they will be public static
 *  5. Methods are public and abstract by default
 *  6. No need in Constructor in IF because we don't have instance variables. 
 *  7. We CANNOT create an OBJECT of a constructor
