		 Car obj =new Car();
		 
	//Car is class name
	// obj - reference variable (object name)
	// = - assigning operator
	//new - keyword that creates a new object of your class
	// Car() - constructor 
Constructor - special type of method, has same name as Class name
		      block of codes that gets executed whenever we create a new object
		      we can use access modifiers with constructors
			  it is possible to provide parameters just like in method
		      constructor CAN"T have non access modifiers an return type
		         
If you don't create any constructor - Java will create 1 default constructor for you
If you create a constructor - compiler will not create default constructor

Main role of constructor is to initialize instance variables

We CANNOT Constructor as static 

When we make private Constructor we can't instantiate the class within itself, but you won't be able
to instantiate it in different class

//EVERYTIME we create a new object, constructor is automatically called and executed	
 * 
 * CONSTRUCTOR VS METHOD 
 * DIFFERENCES
 * 
 * 1. Constructor MUST be the same name as a CLASS
 * Method can have ANY name
 * 
 * 2. Constructor can NOT have a return type, even VOID
 * Method MUST have return type
 * 
 * 3. Constructor CAN NOT be STATIC
 * Method CAN be static or non-static 
 * 
 * 4. Constructor is getting called automatically
 * Method needs to be called
 * 
 * 5. If we WON'T define a constructor - compiler will create one default for you
 * Method: compiler will not create a method automatically 
 * 
 * CONSTRUCTOR VS METHOD 
 * SIMILARITIES
 * 
 * 1. Both Constructors and Methods HAVE/MIGHT NOT HAVE parameters
 * 2. Access modifiers can be used
