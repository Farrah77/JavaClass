/* JAVA OOPS 
 * There 4 main  
 * 1. Inheritance
 * 2. Polymorphism
 * 3. Encapsulation
 * 4. Abstraction
 * 
 * Inheritance 
 * Parent Class/Super Class/Base Class
 * Child Class/Sub Class/Derived Class
 * Multiple inheritance s not available through the classes( 2 classes cannot give 1 subclass)
 * Private members don't participate 
 * Subclass can extend only 1 Super class
 * 
 * 2. Polymorphism - ability of object to take (have) many forms/behaviors
 * I as an object have different types of behaviors 
 * It is about behaviors not variables. 
 * 
 * In JAVA 2 types of P/M:
 * 1 - Compile type (or static binding, or early binding)
 * Compile type can be achieved through method overloading 
 * 2. Runtime  type (or dynamic binding, or late binding) 
 * Runtime type can be achieved through method method overriding 
 * 
 * OVERLOADING:
 * we can overload the METHOD and CONSTRUCTOR
 * 
 *  Method overloading can be achieved in 2 ways: (same method used many times)
 *  - by changing number or arguments (or parameters)
 * 
 *  - by changing data type of the parameters
 *  
 * Method overloading is not possible with return type - compiler will give an error
 * IQ: We can overload Constructor (by chnaging number of parameters or Data Type of parameters
 * IQ: Can we overload main method 
 * 
 * OVERRIDING 
 *
