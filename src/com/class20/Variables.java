/* Variables in Java:
 * Local variable - declared and accessed only inside the method { }

 * public void hello(String name) { // first executes this method 
		name="Jack";
		
		System.out.println("Hello "+name); }
		
 * We CAN"T USE LOCAL VARIABLES ACCESS MODIFIERS
 * 
 * dataType   nameOfTheMethod - syntax
 * 
 * Instance (global) variable -  declared inside the class but outside of method, constructor
 * or block; accessible within a class.
 * 
 * We can access them through OBJECT
 * 
 * Static/Class (global) - declared inside the class but outside the method, constructor,block and 
 * they use STATIC keyword 
 * for classes that have similar attributes e can use static variables: like human have 2 hands, 
 * 2 legs, 2 eyes, etc.. but names are different
 * 
 * 3 ways to access static variable:
 * just by variable name  breed
 * by class name          Dog.breed
 * through the object     obj.breed - not preferred way
 *
